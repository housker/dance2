[Dancer is a vanilla JavaScript/jQuery client with a simple Express server. Geometric "dancers" are instantiated pseudoclassically, inheriting from a superclass. They are variegated and randomly spaced with CSS. Their opacity varies with sound frequency. Frequency data is retrieved from AudioContext, updating the analyser bars rendered on a canvas element through a requestAnimationFrame.](https://quiet-forest-23301.herokuapp.com/)
